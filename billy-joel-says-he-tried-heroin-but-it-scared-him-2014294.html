"It scared me." He has spoken about his relationship with alcohol in the past, opening up after he was involved in three car accidents in the early 2000s and subsequently entered treatment for substance abuse.&nbsp;</p><p>"I was kind of in a mental fog, and it had nothing to do with the booze," <a href=#>Joel told the New York Times</a> in May 2013. "My mind wasn’t right. I wasn’t focused. I went into a deep, deep depression after 9/11. 9/11 just knocked the wind out of me, and I don’t know even now if I’ve recovered from it… I used booze as medication."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Monday's event, which played host to big names including <strong><a href=#>Pink</a></strong>, <strong>Melissa Etheridge</strong>, and <strong><a href=#>Idina Menzel</a></strong>, also had Joel touching on the time he went to Woodstock, his love for the classic "Piano Man," and his future.</p><p>The "Big Shot" singer is currently holding a residency at New York's Madison Square Garden, where he performs a monthly show.
