“You really can’t make that up,” Shea told 1010 WINS radio of the story exclusively reported by The Post. “I mean if you read that story, you think it’s not true but, unfortunately, it’s tragically true."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I gotta get another gun.’”</p><p>Thomas, 36, said, “It don’t make sense, someone gets arrested with a gun and comes home.”</p><p>“Look at these kids. It’s not a big thing for them to get caught with a gun. We’re teaching these kids that lesson,” he said.</p><p>Thomas added: “But if you think, ‘I got caught with a loaded firearm and I gotta do three years,’ I think it would change out here.”</p><p>Another friend who declined to give his name also said lenient treatment by the courts was emboldening violent, gun-toting teens.</p><p>“They growin’ like this now! They know nothing gonna happen. No fear. No fear of nothin’! The cops, killin’, jail, nothin’! Stone cold,” the 31-year-old man said.</p><p>“Ask the cops who came, they know. It ain’t men shooting people. They come here that night, they ain’t looking at me! Or him or him! We were right here! They looking at these little bastards.”</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default">Eric Velasquez with his son, Jax.</figure><p>Ramirez surrendered to cops on Monday and charged with second-degree murder, first-degree manslaughter and two counts of criminal possession of a weapon.</p><p>He has pleaded not guilty and is being held without bail.</p><p>Thomas said Velazquez lives in Yonkers and had brought his kids to visit their grandma when he was slain.</p><figure class="alignright size-nypost-inline-default">Alberto Ramirez was released after acting Bronx state Supreme Court Justice Denis Boyle reduced his bail in March.</figure><p>Ramirez lives with his family in a subsidized, luxury apartment building about five blocks from the shooting scene.</p><p>The “Creston Avenue Residence” opened in 2015 and is operated by the Volunteers of America-Greater New York, which says it “provides a safe, supportive environment for some of the city’s most at-risk residents.”</p><p>A doorman wouldn’t let The Post enter but Ramirez’s sister disputed the allegations against him during a brief telephone interview.</p><p>“I don’t know why they say he did it. There ain’t no photos, no video saying he did it,” Marisol Duran, 30, said.</p><p>“He’s a good kid. He’s a very good kid! In the past, he’s had his issues. He lost his father.”</p><p>She added: “We’re still trying to figure out what happened. There’s a lot of lies being said about him. This is still under investigation.”</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnnq69pXnTqKdmm5%2BleqWx0aamrWWjnbKiecKao6WrXZu8s3nBmqClZaKas7C%2BzGagp2Wnlrimec6fZKmno6l6psTCpaysoaaafA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
