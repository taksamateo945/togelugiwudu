Here is a breakdown of how much Brooda Shaggi makes from his various career endeavors</p><h3><b>His Social Media Comedy Skits</b></h3><p><span>Broda Shaggi’s journey into becoming an internet sensation began at a young age. Still, he officially took off his professional career in 2018 when he shared his parody drama “Jesu in Mushin” on his Instagram page. The skit was received with much appreciation, and it was what brought him to stardom.

Broda Shaggi is an alumnus of the <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>University of Lagos</a>, where he bagged a </span>Bachelor’s degree in Creative Arts.</p><p><span>Broda Sgaggi’s video came through because of his choice to make comedy a serious business while still in college.

In addition to being an actor and a comedian, he is also a singer/songwriter. His music interests presently haven’t seemed to have turned into a critical pay source.

His parents are drama teachers. Although his mother’s identity is unknown, Broda Shaggi revealed that his mother was a drama teacher, and his father also taught at Mayflower Junior High School as a drama teacher.</span></p><p><span>It is not revealed if Broda Shaggi has siblings, as many details about his childhood years are still unknown. But one certain thing is that he was born and brought up in Lagos, regarded as the “Center of Excellence.”&nbsp;</span><span>His parent’s line of work played a huge role in creating a career path for Broda Shaggi. His dad kicked the bucket while Shaggi was still a young boy and his mother never got remarried.</span></p><p><span>His father’s death dealt a huge blow to his family as his mother struggled to make ends meet. But after managing to round up his secondary school education, he got admitted into UNILAG, where he read Creative Arts for four years. It was there that he discovered that he could monetize his passion for acting and comedy content creation.</span></p><h2><strong>His Quest to Make Money Led Him Into Comedy</strong></h2><p>Broda Shaggi is among the very few individuals who successfully thrive in the entertainment industry. His ability to do anything that has to do with entertainment earns him the reputation as one of the most successful entertainers in the industry. Samuel was never raised with a silver spoon, but the<span> number of years he spent with his father had helped him </span><span>solidify an enduring enthusiasm for entertainment. While his character drew chuckles from loved ones, he didn’t view acting or his comic nature in a serious way until he was in UNILAG.</span></p><p><span>Even as a Visual Arts student, he still got the chance to be part of many theater plays at school. He also starred in a couple of Yoruba films, though in minor roles. None of his roles was sufficient to give him the recognition he desired from the media. After he graduated from UNILAG, he moved back in with his mother but soon relocated to Lagos Island in search of jobs that could help him earn a living and possibly take care of his mother.</span></p><p>Though he acts like a street urchin from the notorious Lagos mainland neighborhood of Mushin, Samuel has never lived there. He was living in the up-market Lekki when the character of Broda Shaggi was conceived. The entertainer got his chance to move to the top through <span>hard work and consistency, but he also <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>admits that “hunger” helped him find his talent.</a></span></p><h2><strong>How Broda Shaggi Came About His famous Alias&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><span>Before creating the famous alias he is known for today, he tried out several other comic characters such as Inspector Perry, Akanni Ibadan, and Professor Dele.&nbsp;</span><span>Nonetheless, on an irregular visit to the automobile repair shop in December 2017, he met a few people interacting in a language and style common to Lagos agbero. How the guys at the repair shop spoke made a passer-by who overheard their conversation burst out in laughter, not by what they said by how they spoke.</span></p><p><span>That gesture immediately prompted Broda Shaggi, who was just an observer at that moment, to realize he could imitate the same style of talking and build up a comic character from it.&nbsp;</span><span>He considered various names for his new character, including Musiliu and Shaggi Don Baba. At last, he came up with Broda Shaggi, a choice that eventually brought his family’s monetary battles to an abrupt end. It has equally earned him international fame and a reason to keep smiling to the bank.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK57xKebnpmmpL%2B0edOhmK1lk6S7tb7Im6ytnV2pvG6u0aibmmWjna6os8isZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
