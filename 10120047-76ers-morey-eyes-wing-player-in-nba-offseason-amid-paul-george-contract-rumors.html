Music to Sixers fans ears. I think he's got something cooking up.</p><p>A potential target could be Los Angeles Clippers wing Paul George, as <a href=# rel=noopener>Sam Amick and Law Murray</a> of The Athletic reported on Saturday that the 76ers could pursue George in free agency if he declines his $48.78 million player option for the 2024-25 season (via <a href=# rel=noopener>Spotrac</a>).</p><p>While Amick and Murray added that George and the Clippers have held "extensive discussions" regarding his contract, Philadelphia could swoop in with an offer if the two sides do not reach an agreement before the start of free agency.</p><p>When speaking about the 76ers' offseason plans during a Friday appearance on <i>Get Up</i>, ESPN's Brian Windhorst revealed that George is "the player at the top of their list."</p>Get Up <span class=acct>@GetUpESPN</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>"The player at the top of their list is Paul George."&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WindhorstESPN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WindhorstESPN&lt;/a> thinks the Sixers are going to give PG-13 a max contract offer in free agency, and will look to monitor Jimmy Butler and Brandon Ingram's situations ðŸ‘€ &lt;a href="https://t.co/bRVVY1XeeO">pic.twitter.com/bRVVY1XeeO&lt;/a></p><p>According to ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>Bobby Marks</a>, Philadelphia will have just under $60 million in cap space during the offseason to build around stars Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey.</p><p>Morey could be interested in George due to his ability to remain effective both on and off the ball, potentially operating as a floor-spacing option for Embiid and Maxey when he's not initiating the offense. During the 2023-24 season, the Clippers All-Star connected on 45.4 percent of his catch-and-shoot threes (via <a href=# rel=noopener>NBA.com</a>).</p><p>While George has established himself as one of the league's top wing players, his performances in the playoffs haven't always matched his regular-season production. In 38 playoff games with Los Angeles, the 34-year-old has averaged 23.4 points per game while shooting just 42.3 percent from the field and 34.0 percent from behind the arc.</p><p>This includes the team's 2024 first-round exit, as George shot just 6-of-18 during the Clippers' Game 6 loss to the Dallas Mavericks that ended the series.</p><p>Still, the nine-time All-Star could thrive alongside Embiid and Maxey in order to help the 76ers bounce back from a first-round playoff exit of their own.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmV9dYOMcG2eqqNiurC%2BxLJknrGVqHq4tc2gZKmkka6ys3nIp2SnmpFivKey0p6YrKeeYq6utcNmp5qtnGK0prvRoJxmm5%2BjwbOtwq1kq62dpL%2B0</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
