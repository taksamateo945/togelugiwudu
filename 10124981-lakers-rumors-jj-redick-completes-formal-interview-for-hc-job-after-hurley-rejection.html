He notably has never been a head coach at any level.</p><p>Woike reported that Redick has had "multiple conversations" with Lakers vice president of basketball operations Rob Pelinka since the team fired former head coach Darvin Ham. He also has a podcast with current Laker star LeBron James, which could potentially help the team resign him this Summer.</p><p>Redick played 15 seasons in the NBA for six different franchises. He averaged 12.8 points, two rebounds and two assists in his career and played in 110 playoff games.</p><p>While he would not have significant experience to work with, his long career in the league and familiarity with the modern game could be what helps him get this opportunity. The Lakers went 47-25 and were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmmGeX2MpZiknaKoerPBzKiprGWan3qzscOimqRlk6S6sbjErZysZZakv66ty2agp6yVp8OqsdZmnaiqXZ2wbrbOm2SanqSav2601KujnrFdp7KrscKtoKim</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
