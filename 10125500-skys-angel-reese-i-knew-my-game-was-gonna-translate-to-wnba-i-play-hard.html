The former Maryland and LSU star averaged a double-double over a four-year college career that included numerous individual and team accolades. She also possessed a skill set with some obvious strengths.</p><p>"She does what she does," one WNBA general manager said to ESPN.com's <a href=# rel=noopener>Katie Barnes</a> in April. "She's a tremendous rebounder. She gets to the free throw line. She has a high IQ and can impact your defense."</p><p>Regardless of where her pro ceiling ultimately resides, Reese is displaying right now why she has a long, productive career ahead.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmqCcXyMrKKyq12Wu6ixy2apnp2jmnqqecqnnLBlna56qK3MnmSwmaNitLC6zZpkraqRo8CtrdOeZK2nXay7o62MomSppJGueqmt0Z0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
