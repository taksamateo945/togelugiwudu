The celebrity father recently shared pictures of his wife and kids with Instagram fans.</p><p>“Turtle Wranglers plus the turtles,” Lance captioned underneath a post that showed him with the family. Three out of four members of the group were smiling. Berkeley didn’t appear to be in the mood to smile. The little one kept a straight face while staring into the camera’s lens.</p><p>“What a beautiful family,” one fan exclaimed. “She has strong genes,” another fan said of Berkeley. Both Berkeley and her younger brother, Lennon, do have similar features.</p><p>It was just a few weeks ago that <a href=#>Lance Gross battled with critics</a> who attempted to slam him for valuing his daughter’s light skin all while praising his son’s darker tone. “Little man’s color is comin’ in nicely,” Lance told his social media fans all while sharing a picture of his then-infant son. “He’s happy his son’s COLOR is coming in…. Mr. Colorism,” one critic wrote in response to the Instagram post. “I guess it’s only cool that black men are dark skin and not black women cuz you wasn’t hoping for COLOR to come in for your Baby girl! Man hush up and act.”</p><p>Lance Gross did not let the criticism go unaddressed. “Two things I’m proud of is the ability to smile through any situation and the rich melanin that layers my body,” the celebrity father said. “For my daughter or son to share that blessing makes me overjoyed. Miss me with the self-hate, ’cause those opinions and assumptions are invalid.”</p><p>Berkeley and Lennon are Lance’s children with his wife, Rebecca Gross. Stay tuned for more celebrity family news!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kHFmamhfZn5wuMCnmp5ll6e8tL%2BMsKCfnV2Wu6V5yqKbrGWgpMCmecWoqWasmJp6pK3MnqmaZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
