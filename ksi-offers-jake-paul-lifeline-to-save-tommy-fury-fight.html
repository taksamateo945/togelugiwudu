KSI offers Jake Paul a ‘lifeline’
The 25-year-old boxer was set to fight former Tommy, 23, in a clash at Madison Square Garden in New York, but the former ‘Love Island’ star was denied entry to the US for a press event this week as his ESTA was rejected, and now the ‘Holiday’ hitmaker has offered his own card to Jake as a “lifeline”."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So lemme give you a lifeline. If you TRULY want to fight Tommy, fight on my card as the co main event.</p><p>“I’ve got everything set up for you. Best believe you owe me though. Ball is in your court. (sic)”</p><p>KSI – whose real name is Olajide Olayinka Williams Olatunji – was replying to a post from a disgruntled Jake, who had tweeted Tommy to insist that he was not going to “weasel” his way out of the match and branded his fellow sports star a “scared little b****”.</p><p>Jake’s tweet read: “Tommy, no matter how hard u try to get out of this fight, I’m going 2 do everything in my power 2 not let u weasel ur way out.</p><p>“My team my partners have made it clear the steps u need to take 2 solve ur latest excuse. Take them or admit ur a scared little b****. #TommyFumbles.(sic)”</p><p>It remains unclear whether the fight will take place as scheduled on August 6 and Tommy – who is the younger brother of boxing legend Tyson Fury – took to Instagram on Monday (27.06.22) to insist he had “no idea” why he was denied entry into the states.</p><p>He said: “Me and my team this morning arrived at Heathrow Airport ready for the press conference, ready to fly out.</p><p>“And as soon as I entered the airport I got pulled to one side and I was told by the Homeland Security officer that was there that my ESTA had been denied and I wasn’t able to travel to the USA for a reason that I apparently know.</p><p>“I have no clue why they would not allow me to travel today and neither does any of my team or my lawyers.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOpKqiZZ%2Bbs6a%2B0mahmqOVYr2iwctmo6KelaG2r7GMraZmq5Grsm7AzqaksmWWqr%2B6ecWinqGsXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
