Amidst rumors that they are dating, <strong>Ariana Grande</strong> and <strong>Big Sean</strong> dropped a new song together on Monday, Aug. 11.&nbsp;</p><p>The pair collaborated for “Best Mistake,” the latest single off of Grande’s upcoming album My Everything. The smooth R&B song has Grande, 21, crooning, “Cause you’re the best mistake I’ve ever made / But we hold on, hold on / There’s no pot of gold at the rainbow, sweet Jesus / But we’re holding on, hold on.”&nbsp;</p><p>Big Sean, 26, joins “Best Mistake” midway through the song, rapping, “I know sometimes it’s hard to realize I’m the man that you need / I had a dream we branched out started a family tree / And I feel like that everything we do is overdue / You asked why I love your mom so much cause she’s an older you.”</p><p>Grande called the track her “favorite one yet.” “Best Mistake” follows earlier singles “Problem” with <strong>Iggy Azalea</strong> (one of the biggest songs of the summer) and “Break Free” with <strong>Zedd</strong> off of My Everything, which is set to hit stores later this month.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Ariana Grande and Big Sean" width=467 height=438 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>After breaking up with her boyfriend <strong>Jai Brooks</strong> <a href=#>for the second time earlier this month</a>, Grande has been romantically linked to Big Sean. On Aug. 4, the singer posted a vague message about her love troubles, writing, “You learn a lot about love, life and the people around you during a time of crisis.” Explaining that the loss of her grandfather was a painful experience in July, she added, “I thank everybody who was here for me when I needed them as the ones who weren’t really broke my heart.”</p><p>Big Sean <a href=#>recently went through a breakup of his own</a> — an ugly one, by all accounts. The “Control” rapper ended his engagement to Glee actress <strong><a href=#>Naya Rivera</a></strong> in April, <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> broke exclusively.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“After careful thought and much consideration, Sean has made the difficult decision to call the wedding off,” his rep told Us at the time. “Sean wishes Naya nothing but the best and it is still his hope that they can continue to work through their issues privately.”&nbsp;</p><p>The estranged couple clearly did not work through their issues as Rivera got married to someone else <a href=#>just three months later</a>. She exchanged vows with actor <strong>Ryan Dorsey</strong> in July, on the day she was intending to say “I do” to Big Sean. Sean may be moving on with Grande, however neither star has commented on the matter.</p><p>Take a listen to “Best Mistake” above!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOmqmimZ6Weqi%2BwKebnmWSnrRuv8SapWaqlaGyor%2FEZpmeq6Riuqq%2F05qinmWRoralv9Nmm5qsmaO0br7Upqarq11nfXKAkGtv</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
