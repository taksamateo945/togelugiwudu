Victoria is said to have made an extensive effort to get to know Chloe better as well. The source said ‘She was sat chatting to her for ages and was clearly interested in finding out more about her life.’ Brooklyn and Chloe were also very comfortable together, with Chloe putting her head on Brooklyn’s shoulder continuously and Brooklyn doing the same.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/are-brooklyn-beckham-and-chloe-grace-moretz-back-on-01.jpg alt="Are Brooklyn Beckham and Chloe Grace Moretz Back On? 1" width=634 height=855 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Chloe has previously said in an interview that she isn’t ready for serious relationships at the moment as she wouldn’t be able to handle it.

They first met at Paris Fashion Week a few months before the summer of 2014 and during the summer they spent a lot of time together in LA, skateboarding and hanging around by the beach. They were also seen together at several music events, including Jay Z’s Made In America festival.</p><p>Aren’t they a cute couple?
