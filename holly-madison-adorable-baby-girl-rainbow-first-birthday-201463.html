Holly Madison and husband Pasquale Rotella celebrated the first birthday of their adorable daughter Rainbow Aurora on Wednesday, Mar. 5.</p><p>"I can't believe my little girl is one today!! I'm emotional," Madison, 34, wrote beside an Instagram picture of her wide-eyed little one adorably staring up at her. Dad Rotella was equally as excited about his daughter hitting 12 months and wrote an extended message about his little one.</p><p>"One year ago today, I received a gift that changed my life in ways I never thought possible," wrote the Insomniac Events founder alongside a picture of himself holding his baby girl. "The lessons I've learned through her about love, family, and commitment reverberate through everything I do, and I wake up every day with the motivation to make the world a better place for her to live in. Every time I look in her big blue eyes, I'm reminded that I truly am the luckiest guy in the world. Happy 1st Birthday, Rainbow!!!"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The proud parents have taken great strides to help their baby girl achieve certain milestones — which includes learning sign language! "Supposedly [babies] can learn to sign before they can speak," Madison told Us Weekly at the Las Vegas premiere of Homefront last November. "It cuts down on a lot of the frustration time, so I've been taking her to sign language class."</p><p>While celebrating her birthday back in December, the first-time mom told Us that Rainbow will hopefully have a signing sibling soon. "Most of next year I'm going to be concentrating on working and stuff, but hopefully by the end of next year," she said of the couple's timeline. "We definitely want more kids sometime soon."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaJ%2BopJyueq6tw6KqqKZdlrGwvsCbo55lkpavunnGoqmlZaKWtq%2BuzrBkn6GiqMFursirq6Gcka56c3yQbW1s</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
