You’ll collect parts and characters while you race against other players to stand proudly on the podium.&nbsp;</p><h3>Collect, upgrade, and purchase</h3>This game puts you back into one of many go-karts from the classic title with new maps, characters, and items.<p>Developed specifically for mobile devices, Mario Kart Tour is the official racing title from Nintendo. Ever since the start of this game’s series, the selection of riders and maps has steadily grown, and the entertainment alongside with it.&nbsp;</p><p>The controls are easy to learn. All you need to do is drag your finger across the screen to steer your kart to the finishing line. The kart will automatically accelerate, save a few special moments where your timing plays a role. Along the way, you’ll run into marked boxes that contain randomized items. These include shells, mushroom, and bananas. You'll need to use them to temporarily increase your speed, knock nearby players into the air, or trip up the other players lagging behind. These small details are what breathe great, yet short bursts of fun into every race.</p><p>The graphics in this iteration stay faithful to the original style. They’ve improved quite a bit, though. The colors pop out and are a perfect fit for the game. As you race along, you’ll notice a few scenes that are inspired by real-life locations. These are new tracks that add a new spin on the traditional maps.</p><p>The main element that’ll keep you playing every day, aside from your need for speed, is the collection aspect of the game. In Mario Kart Tour, you can hoard a variety of items. These include characters, upgrades, gliders, and karts. These are difficult to gather and are mostly a way to justify some aggressive microtransactions. In this case, you’re better off playing in a casual manner.</p><h3>Where can you run this program?</h3><p>This title is available for Android 4.4 and later. It also runs on iOS 10 and above.</p><h3>Is there a better alternative?</h3><p>No. For mobile, this game is the real deal. There are other fun racing games, like Beach Buggy Blitz, but it doesn’t keep up with Mario Kart Tour.</p><h3>Our take</h3><p>This game has all the original and wacky characters that came with the first iteration. It’s fun, fast, and addictive. It’s definitely one-of-a-kind and a must-have for racing fans.</p><h3>Should you download it?</h3><p>Yes. If you’re looking for a go-kart game with a twist, this is a fantastic choice.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmicn6y7rbvAnapnnJmctrWty62pnqaUqHuku8xopJqqmaR6rK3RrWStp6WnfKq70g%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
