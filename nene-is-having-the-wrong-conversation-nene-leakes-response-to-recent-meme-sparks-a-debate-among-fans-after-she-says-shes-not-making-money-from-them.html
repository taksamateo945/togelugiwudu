Black TikTok creators recently went on strike to protest the lack of credit they were receiving for the dances they choreographed that went on to go viral and, in turn, make money for the platform and artists whose songs they sampled.</p><p>“TikTok is a special place because of the diverse and inspiring voices of our community, and our Black creators are a critical and vibrant part of this,” TikTok responded in a statement. “We care deeply about the experience of Black creators on our platform and we continue to work every day to create a supportive environment for our community while also instilling a culture where honoring and crediting creators for their creative contributions is the norm.”</p><p>As for Nene, fans were taken aback by her response and debated whether or not she actually had a point, or should just laugh and enjoy the free publicity.</p><p>“Nene is having the wrong conversation. She had years to license and trademark so much of her own content during the height of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">#RHOA</a>-mania. But she didn’t. Now, she mad her herself bc she thought Bravo would always need her and that’s not how employment works,” said one fan.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nene is having the wrong conversation.</p><p>She had years to license and trademark so much of her own content during the height of <a href=#>#RHOA</a>-mania.
