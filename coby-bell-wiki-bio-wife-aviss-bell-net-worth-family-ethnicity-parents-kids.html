Coby is best known for his acting career, especially for his roles in <a rel=nofollow href=#>“The Game”</a> and “Third Watch” TV series, while he is also a producer and songwriter.</p><h2><span id=Early_life_and_education>Early life and education</span></h2><p>Coby is the son of a Caucasian mother, Kathy A. Lathrop, while his African-American father is the famous Broadway actor named <a rel=nofollow href=#>Michel Bell</a>. Coby went to San Clemente High School and after he matriculated attended and graduated from San Jose State University – soon afterwards, he landed his first roles in 1997, in “The Parent ‘Hood”, “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and “ER” TV series.</p><h2><span id=Michel_Bell>Michel Bell</span></h2><p>Some say that Coby strives to become as popular as his father, which may be difficult to achieve – Michel was nominated for a Tony Award but although that might mean a lot to some, for him it was just one of many achievements. He was nominated for his portrayal of Joe in Hal Prince’s “Show Boat” production, while he also appeared in the “Civil War” musical on Broadway, and “Riverdance: The Musical”. One can say that the biggest achievement of his life was when he performed on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial at the “American’s Millennium” celebration in 2000 – he was being watched by over 600,000 people together with the President and the First Lady.</p><p>Michel has performed with some of the most famous operas in the US, including San Diego Opera, Michigan Opera, and Lyric Opera, while he also performed with the L.A. Philharmonic, San Diego Symphony, Berlin Radio Orchestra, and the New York Philharmonic. He has won awards such as the Jefferson Award, Ovation Award, the Outer Critic’s Circle Award, and the Kevin Kline award, which is why a nomination for a Tony Award did not represent a major achievement for Michel.</p><p>He was once also a member of a pop vocal group called “The Fifth Dimension”, and had a chance to perform with some worldwide famous artists such as Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Perry Como, and Sammy Davis Jr.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2><span id=Cobys_career_in_TV_series>Coby’s career in TV series</span></h2><p>Coby won his first recurring role in the <a rel=nofollow href=#>“L.A. Doctors”</a> TV series, appearing in 13 episodes in 1998 and 1999.

After this, he appeared in several TV series such as <a rel=nofollow href=#>“Hot in Cleveland”</a> in 2014, “Mad Dogs” in 2016, and “The Quad” in 2017 before he landed his latest major role in “The Gifted” in 2017, and is still shooting for it today.</p><p>Coby has appeared in five movies, although they haven’t done as much for his career as his TV roles – the movies in which he’s appeared include “Dream Street” in 2005, “Drifting Elegant” in 2006, <a rel=nofollow href=#>“Showdown at Area 51”</a> in 2007, and “Ball Don’t Lie” and “Flowers and Weeds” in 2008.</p><h2><span id=Personal_life_and_likes>Personal life and likes</span></h2><p>Coby married the love of his life Aviss Pinkney Bell on 9 June 2001 and the couple has four kids together, twins named Serrae and Jaena born on 21 June 2003, and Quinn and Eli, twins as well, born on 2 December 2008 – the family is currently living in New York City.</p><p>Coby has other interests as well – he is very good at both basketball and tennis, while he also sings and plays keyboard in a band.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/maxresdefault-7-1024x576.jpg><h2><span id=Aviss_Pinkney_Bell>Aviss Pinkney Bell</span></h2><p>There is not much known about Aviss, as she tries to stay away from media attention.

The organization has been around for more than 100 years, and is one of the nation’s largest donor and the biggest volunteering organization in the US – their goal is to help children who are facing adversity find their strength by connecting them to an older professional who will do whatever it takes to change their lives, and that is what Coby does, as he is one of the mentors in charge of connecting with the children.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Yay Monday!!<br>New episode of THE GIFTED tonight @9/8c on FO❌.<a rel=nofollow href=#>#TheGifted</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>#marvel</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>#JaceAllUpinYoFace</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/9JOk2dxtWX</a></p><p>— Coby Bell (@imcobybell) <a rel=nofollow href=#>November 6, 2017</a></p><h2><span id=Appearance_and_net_worth>Appearance and net worth</span></h2><p>Coby is currently 43 years old, has very short hair, so short that he almost appears bald; he has dark brown eyes, is 6ft 3ins (1.91m) tall, and weighs around 192lbs (87kg).
