But it is the oldest. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to The Jerusalem Post</a>, another gate was found nearby last year.

The ruins around the gate suggest that 3,000 years ago, Bethsaida may not have been part of an Israelite kingdom, but rather an Aramaic one.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-222927 alt="Archaeologist Discovers An Artifact At Bethsaida" width=610 height=406 data-sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/archaeologist-discovers-an-artifact-at-bethsaida.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-222927 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Rami Arav/University of Nebraska</span><span class=caption-body>At Bethsaida, where the ancient gate was unearthed, archaeologists have also found jewelry and coins.</span></p><p>Archaeologists found a stone stele bearing the image of the Arameans’ bull-shaped moon god dated to the 11th century B.C.</p><p>The newly found gate <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">indicates</a> that the city was once a well-protected and important urban center.</p><p>Following the excavation project’s start and its subsequent identification of the ancient site of Bethsaida in the late 1980s, masses of Christian pilgrims have visited the site because of its significance in Christianity.</p><p>Over the years, researchers have discovered ancient ruins originating from various time periods at Bethsaida.</p><p>Just last year, researchers unearthed the floor of a Roman temple that was built by Herod’s son Philip in the first century A.D., and which he dedicated to Julia, daughter of Roman Emperor Augustus.</p><p>Archaeologists also found jewelry and coins, one of which dated back to 35 B.C. and was made to commemorate the arrival of Cleopatra and Marc Antony.
