The couple is still married as of 2021. Abe and Rebecca eventually announced their departure from Return to Amish after season 4 in 2017. “It’s been a long road to come to this decision as a family and to move on to things that make us happy and brings us closer to where we want to be,” Rebecca tweeted in 2017.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_wrong_with_Danny%E2%80%99s_teeth_on_Return_to_Amish></span><strong>What is wrong with Danny’s teeth on Return to Amish?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Danny’s appearance is the result of a childhood accident.

Drano is meant to remove clogs in drains. The doctors had recommended that he should get plastic surgery done to cover the scars up but the Amish community was against the idea.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Maureen_leave_the_Amish></span><strong>Does Maureen leave the Amish?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In addition to leaving her loved ones and her beloved job as a teacher behind, Maureen must also temporarily say goodbye to Daniel Byler.

Sabrina lost custody of Oakley in 2015, reportedly because of her drug issues, and lost custody of her second daughter later on. But we won’t be seeing either of those girls on Return to Amish.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_Jeremiah_and_Carmela_still_together></span><strong>Are Jeremiah and Carmela still together?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After several days of fan speculation, Jeremiah took to Instagram on March 25, confirming he and Carmela were “no longer together” and their relationship was “officially done.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_did_Sabrina_lose_Oakley_the_second_time></span><strong>Why did Sabrina lose Oakley the second time?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Why did Sabrina lose Oakley?

There are a few reasons for Chapel’s disappearance from the show, but just to set the record straight, the reality TV personality is not dead. She has been under the radar following some dramatic things that have transpired in her life.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Ada_Byler_on_Return_to_Amish></span><strong>Who is Ada Byler on Return to Amish?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ada is known as Maureen’s grandmother on TLC’s Return To Amish. Fans are starting to wonder exactly who she is, and what she does.

Yet, their children have half as many cavities as other U.S. children and they suffer less gum disease.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Chapel_from_Amish_still_alive></span><strong>Is Chapel from Amish still alive?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, she’s very much alive.
