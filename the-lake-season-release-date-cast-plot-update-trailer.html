Justin, openly gay, plans to connect with his <a href=#>teenage</a> daughter he gave up for adoption long ago. Justin has plans to make new memories with his daughter at the family cottage, but to his disappointment, Justin finds out that his parents have left the cottage to his picture-perfect step-sister, Maisey-May.&nbsp;Justin is so obsessed with the cottage that he won’t let it just go like that.</p><p>After doing some research, Justin finds out that the only way he can inherit the cottage is if Maisy dies. He comes up with another plan and hits Maisey with the fact that the cottage is not up to code; however, Maisey had already anticipated Justin’s move about the home and knew about the weak spots and renovations. She invites Riley, knowing that a cute guy will distract Justin from the upgrades. The organized game night moves into coupling up. What follows is a tussle between the two as one struggles to keep the house while the other struggles to gain ownership of the cottage.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Lake Season 2 Cast: Who will be appearing?</h2><p>Lead cast Jordan Gavaris is portrayed as Justin, a gay man returning home to reconnect with <a href=#>family</a>.
