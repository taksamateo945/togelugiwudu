Ree mentioned in the blog post that Chuck died quietly in his sleep.&nbsp;She also said that her father-in-health laws have deteriorated in recent months. She did not say if he was hospitalized before his death.</p><p>Ree said on Facebook about her blog:</p><p>“Many of you knew Pa-Pa through my blog and culinary program over the years, and I wanted to let you know the good news.” Thank you for your love and prayers, particularly for Ladd and his brother Tim, as well as the six grandchildren.”</p><h2>“We love you so much, Pa-Pa,” writes Chuck Drummond’s daughter-in-law in a touching tribute to him.</h2><p>Ree made a blog entry on her website, The Pioneer Woman, on November 6, 2022. She told readers in the post that Chuck died peacefully in his sleep on Friday. She went on to say that she delayed a few days to share the news because she needed to “connect with extended family, take a few breaths, and cry some tears.”&nbsp;Ree noted in her blog post that Chuck Drummond’s health had been deteriorating over the previous several months, and his family realized he didn’t have much time left. When asked about her father-in-life, law’s Ree said,</p><p>“Many of you knew Chuck as Pa-Pa, as we all referred to him. He had three sons and taught them all he knew about ranching before passing the torch to his six grandkids.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Chuck-Drummond-2.jpg alt="Chuck Drummond" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Chuck’s grandkids, according to Ree, never acknowledged being bored in front of him because “he’d give you enough labor to cure you of boredom forever!”&nbsp;Chuck was also described as a kind, open-hearted guy who “kept up with distant relatives, coordinated family reunions, and ensured that relationships were preserved throughout the years,” according to her.</p><p>Ree spoke of her own connection with Chuck, saying that he was always there for her, sharing her recipes and watching her QVC shows. She concluded her blog with:</p><p>“We adore you, Pa-Pa.” Thank you for living such an interesting life and allowing us to be a part of it.”</p><h2>Who was Chuck Drummond?</h2><p>Chuck Drummond, also known as Charles Robert Drummond, was born on March 12, 1943, and spent his first five years on his family ranch, where he learned to ride horses. Farming and ranching were major aspects of his life from then on. He was also a big fan of hunting.&nbsp;Chuck was the senior class president and a football player in high school. He subsequently enrolled at Oklahoma State University, where he earned a degree in Agriculture Economics. Chuck encountered various problems as a rancher, including ice storms, varmints, and shifting cow prices.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Chuck-Drummond-3.jpg alt="Chuck Drummond" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Chuck Drummond and Nan Olsen married in August 1964 and had their first child, Todd, in September 1965.
