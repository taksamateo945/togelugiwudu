Kim is taking a lot of heat for selling products throughout the Coronavirus pandemic and her new KKW x KRIS Mother’s Day perfume was met with backlash. Kim and Kris Jenner announced they were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">donating</a> 20 percent of the proceeds to Coronavirus relief efforts but many asked why Kim Kardashian and Kris Jenner weren’t simply giving money from their personal income. Now she is launching her Skims Smooth Essentials line that went on sale on Wednesday, April 8, 2020. Again, not everyone agrees that this is the best time to be selling products, but many people have businesses to run and that includes Kim Kardashian.</p><p>Sharing a photo of three superimposed images of Kim Kardashian, she is sprawled out on the beach as the shallow water pools around Kim’s form. The Skims Smooth Essentials feature five colors and Kim is modeling the cheeky brief in cocoa. It’s easy to see how the panty derived its name and Kim has her famous derriere on full display in the photos. She paired the cheeky briefs with a matching tank in cocoa. You may see the photo that Kim Kardashian shared on the official Skims Instagram account with the included caption below.</p><p>&nbsp;SKIMS Smooth Essentials — launching Wednesday, April 8 at 9 AM PST / 12 PM EST exclusively at SKIMS.COM.

The couple is staying in their Calabassas mansion for the pandemic as California has seen its death toll due to the deadly, novel virus increase.</p><p>There has been a total of 451 deaths in California and there is a state-wide lockdown in order to help flatten the curve and prevent more cases as well as deaths.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>What do you think about the backlash Kim Kardashian has received for continuing to promote her business during the Coronavirus pandemic?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebnrput8Crm5qrmJ6ur3nPrqusZZ%2BjeqJ5wqGcnqOpYrGqv8%2BlmLJlmaN6r7HWZqqkoZ2oerG0zq2mrGWRqHq0tMRmo5qtnpi1pr%2BMp5ywZaOdrrGx1p6Yq2VjbYJ5gJNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
