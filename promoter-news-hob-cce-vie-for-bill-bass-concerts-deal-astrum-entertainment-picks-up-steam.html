BBC's three-year co-promotion contract with HOB in Colorado expires next month. Now, both HOB and CCE are vying for the deal.</p><p>Why the interest? Bass brings five shows annually to Red Rocks, the amphitheater at the heart a heated battle between HOB and CCE last fall over who the primary promoter would be. Both parties reached an agreement where they would each promote at least 10 shows. Bass' five shows are now a valuable commodity in helping either promoter to meet its show quota.</p><p>"No one's ever wanted me before," Bass joked to the Rocky Mountain News. "I'm looking at offers from HOB and Clear Channel, and I'm speaking to a couple of other companies from out of state."</p><p>"I have Widespread Panic, which is why everyone loves me. Let's get real — it's not my personality," Bass said.</p><p>Bass also said he's contemplating retirement soon. So it's likely whichever promoter gets the contract, will continue the relationship with Widespread Panic.</p><p>Whatever his decision, it needs to be made by February 16. "I'm so upset about it that I'm going fishing in Cabo to go after my black marlin, and I'm not coming back till the 11th. When I come back, I believe I'll have a decision."<br></p><p><br><b>Astrum Entertainment Picks Up Steam</b></p><p>Astrum Entertainment, the new concert promotion and production company launched by talent buyer Joe Sarrach in Sterling Heights, MI, is now booking shows at the following Detroit area venues: The Emerald Theatre (1,500 capacity), Crystal Coliseum (5,600); in Ann Arbor: Hill Auditorium (4,000); and East Lansing: Breslin Center (15,000).</p><p>Sarrach can be reached at 586-783-6850; email: info@astrument.com.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaJuRlr%2BktMivnGiooqS6sMDEq2Snnaeoeqm7wWaanJ1dq7amecWoqWaamaG5bq7ArKpmm5%2BjsKa%2B06xknZ2RoXqiv9OrrKZllaPBpr7TmqCnpZWjwW68yJyirGWlpXq0wMSapGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
