Deadspin's John Koblin reports the editor-in-chief of Grantland has been suspended from Twitter for the criticism he offered on the very social media site:

There is no word as to whether he was also sent to bed without supper.&nbsp;</p><p>Deadspin's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Koblin</a> reports the editor-in-chief of Grantland has been suspended from Twitter for the criticism he offered on the very social media site:</p><p>ESPN has suspended Simmons from Twitter for a few days after he called the Skip Bayless-Richard Sherman&nbsp;First Take&nbsp;meltdown last week&nbsp;awful and embarrassing. An ESPN source told me that the tweets violated ESPN's&nbsp;social media guidelines; Simmons was told to lie low for a few days. He hasn't tweeted since&nbsp;Tuesday<span>&nbsp;Monday, and he'll apparently be allowed to return to Twitter tomorrow, making it a three-day hiatus. An ESPN spokesman declined comment, and Simmons didn't respond to an email.</span></p><p>For those of us well aware that being highly critical of your employer is not always a good idea, you can now enjoy your moment of schadenfreude.&nbsp;</p><p>For those of us who found it refreshing that someone from ESPN would actually speak out against the shouting match that is First Take, savor what you just saw.&nbsp;</p><p>As noted, Simmons took to Twitter in a few instances following the awkward moment between Richard Sherman and Skip Bayless.</p><p>Here are some remarks that still remain active on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>.&nbsp;</p>Bill Simmons <span class=acct>@BillSimmons</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>It's amazing to me that people get so worked up about First Take. Who cares? Just don't watch it. There are like 800 TV channels.</p>Bill Simmons <span class=acct>@BillSimmons</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>I am not defending this segment - http://t.co/FHby3bmZea - I thought it was awful and embarrassing to everyone involved. Seriously.</p>Bill Simmons <span class=acct>@BillSimmons</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>But what bothers me about the reaction to that segment is people saying Richard Sherman "won." Nobody won. Everyone lost. Including ESPN.</p><p>Again, this was a moment that many fans found wonderful. When someone from ESPN blasts the show that seems to annoy more than entertain, you are going to win over some appreciative fans.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, the moment Simmons tweeted his critique, most of us had to take a step back and consider the backlash. It was like being a kid all over again and watching one of your buddies tell off their parents in a rare act of defiance.&nbsp;</p><p>The only thing to do in that instance is grab a seat and stick around for the fireworks.&nbsp;</p><p>We have to agree with a couple of B/R personalities in this regard: Matt Miller and Rollin Herold. One does not simply bash their own employer.&nbsp;</p>Rollin Herold <span class=acct>@Iam_Rollin</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hey @nfldraftscout @BillSimmons will #Grantland get better because of this? #ewingtheory Come on, someone had to say it.</p><p>This isn't the first social-media suspension for Simmons, who is arguably the biggest name at ESPN. Back in 2009, he was suspended for two weeks for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeting</a> the following at an&nbsp;ESPN Radio affiliate.&nbsp;</p>Bill Simmons <span class=acct>@BillSimmons</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hey WEEI: You were wrong, I did a Boston interview today. With your competition. Rather give them ratings over deceitful scumbags like you.</p><p>The network has somewhat of a history of asking its writers to cool it on Twitter when things heat up.&nbsp;</p><p>CBS Sports' Bruce Feldman famously described his enforced Twitter hiatus when he worked at ESPN "for his participation in a book with former Texas Tech coach Mike Leach," via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Lead</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Feldman said when the story hit, he was told he couldn’t Tweet, blog, go to the SEC media day and other restrictions. He said that he was on a “do-not-book list.”</p><p>The lesson here, if you are looking for one, is to think before you tweet.&nbsp;</p><p>It doesn't matter if you are some random blogger looking for fame or a household name offering but a voice to an already loud and raucous discourse on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>Tweets may be small, digestible pieces of opinion that are so easily published and later forgotten, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't practice safe tweeting.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, we will wait outside until Billy can come back out to play.&nbsp;</p><p>Hit me up on Twitter for more safe tweeting.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaG5uZ2x9d3nBoqOlZaOeuq67zaxkrK2jpbKvsMSdZJ%2Bqn6J6tcPIraueql2awLG6jKCpqK2emcBuusCunqGsqWK0s63NraOappRisKm1xJ8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
