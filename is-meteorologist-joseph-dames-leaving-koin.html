Hurricane Hilary has rapidly intensified to a category 4, and will be curving back towards land in the coming days.</p><p>Ginger warned followers on the West Coast that Palm Springs and surrounding areas could see a year’s worth of rain in just 24 hours. With the ocean water as warm as it is right now, it’s the literal perfect storm of conditions to provide fuel to the hurricane. Ginger did allay some fears, however. While the storm looks impressive now, it is expected to weaken before making landfall.</p><p>On Instagram, Ginger explained, “Is a hurricane really going to impact the desert southwest?! NO, NOT as a hurricane force BUT YES as a possible tropical storm with heavy rain! Please pay close attention to #Hilary Sunday/Monday in #Nevada #california #utah #arizona.” The GMA meteorologist added, “if it remains tropical storm strength as it crosses border into United States it’s first time this type of path since 1997!”</p><h3 id=gma-meteorologist-ginger-zee-reveals-plans-to-leave-the-show>GMA Meteorologist Ginger Zee Reveals Plans To Leave The Show</h3><p>With that kind of high-stakes coverage, it’s easy to see why fans would be worried about Ginger Zee leaving.</p><p>42-year-old Ginger told fans this week that she will be taking a much-needed and well-deserved break from the show as she enjoys an end-of-summer vacation. The last time she took a break without warning fans, people were concerned that she was gone for good. So this time, Ginger wanted to forewarn everyone and make sure they know that she plans to return.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Really looking forward to some time away next week. As a heads-up, last time I took a few days off everyone thought I died or left abc etc… I am just going to take vacation and time off social. Thank goodness.</p><p>— Ginger Zee (@Ginger_Zee) <a href=#>August 15, 2023</a></p><p>On X, formerly known as Twitter, Ginger posted, “Really looking forward to some time away next week.” The amused meteorologist added, “As a heads-up, last time I took a few days off everyone thought I died or left abc etc… I am just going to take vacation and time off social. Thank goodness.” So if you tune in next week and don’t see Ginger’s smiling face, never fear; she’ll be back.</p><p>Did you worry about the last time Ginger Zee took a vacation?
