From kissing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Madonna</strong></a> to performing “I’m a Slave 4 U” with a live boa constrictor around her neck, the singer has owned the annual awards show many a time. Naturally, each of these crazy situations featured an equally wild ensemble. So as we prepare for the 2020 VMAs, we’re taking a look back at some of the “Toxic” songstress’ wildest and best looks of all time.</p><p>The singer attended the awards show for the first time in 1999. The then 18-year-old had three different looks over the course of the evening, all of which were a touch risqué but nothing like what she ultimately debuted in later years. She arrived on the red carpet in a sheer black coat with a fur lining, performed in a crop top and leather pants and wore something similar in the form of snakeskin pants with a bra when she was spotted backstage.</p><p>Pairing a bra with on-trend super low-rise fitted pants seemed to be a go-to for the “Baby One More Time” singer throughout the early 2000s. In 2007, Spears infamously performed “Gimme More” at the VMAs after a four-year hiatus. She took to the stage wearing a rhinestone bikini with fishnets and black mid-calf boots. The performance was questionable but the outfit was undeniably epic.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>It hasn’t always been about her midriff, however. The blonde beauty also favored cute and playful minidresses, several of which were covered in eye-catching sparkles and/or sparkly sequin embellishments. But our favorite dress of all is the one she wore to the 32nd annual show in 2016. She stunned in an asymmetrical black number that featured a sexy sheer design that teased the star’s cleavage.</p><p>The moral of the story is that Spears is and will always be a VMA style queen.
