Four months later, it was announced that World Peace would not be renewed for a second season. Hyde attributed the show’s cancellation to his vocal support for Donald Trump.</p><p>In 2017, Hyde reportedly pledged $5,000 towards the legal defense fund of Andrew Anglin, the founder and editor of white supremacist website The Daily Stormer. The Southern Poverty Law Center sued Anglin for allegedly organizing a “troll storm” against a Jewish woman in Montana. When Matt Pearce of the Los Angeles Times questioned Hyde about the donation, Hyde asked Pearce if he was Jewish and went on to say that $5,000 was “nothing” to him. Hyde also stated: “Don’t worry so much about money. Worry about if people start deciding to kill reporters. That’s a quote. For the reason why, you can say I want reporters to know I make more money than them, especially Matt Pearce.”</p><p align=justify>Nick, Nick as well as Charles are located in Massachusetts.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sam Hyde</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sam</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hyde</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Youtube Star</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 16</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1995</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Fall River</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Massachusetts</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Sam Hyde ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
