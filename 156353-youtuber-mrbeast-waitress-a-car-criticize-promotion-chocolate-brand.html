The car had the name of the brand written on it and the logo of Donaldson's main YouTube channel on its hood.</p><h2>MrBeast tips waitress with an expensive gift in viral TikTok</h2><p class=align-left>In the <a href=#>TikTok</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">post</a>, which received 50 million views, Donaldson asked Amy about the biggest tip she had ever received. She replied that it was around $50 (R909), to which Donaldson responded by giving her a set of car keys and taking her outside to show her a black Toyota, which he claimed was her brand-new car.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION</strong>: Follow us on <a id=https://www.instagram.com/brieflynews/ href=# title="Briefly News Instagram" rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a> - get the most important news directly in your favourite app!</p><p class=align-left>Amy appeared to tear up and put her hand over her face, thanking Donaldson. The clip ended with Donaldson telling her to enjoy the car.</p><p class=align-left>You see it below:</p><p class=align-left>In a comment on the post from his account, Donaldson said that if fans bought more of his Feastables products, he would give away more <a href=#>cars</a> on social media</p><p class=align-left>While some commenters praised Donaldson for his generous tip, others criticised him for using the act of kindness as product placement. Several <a href=#>Twitter</a> users suggested that the logos on the car made it look less attractive, and one person tweeted:</p>"So basically she has to promote his company by driving the car."<p class=align-left>@BBNFL1984 said:</p>"This dude is king of free publicity."<p class=align-left>But some disagreed with the criticism and felt MrBeast was doing good</p><p class=align-left>@jambo311 said:</p>"Yeah, but the important part is that he gave her a car. I’ve been in some pretty tough times, and if somebody had given me a car so I could get to work, I don’t care what it says or what colour it is - bet 90% of you can’t even remember the last time you helped someone"<p class=align-left>@SpritzWinklbotm said:</p>"You give me a new car, I wouldn't care if it's got a picture of you."<p class=align-left>@HeyElonYouSuck added:</p>"MrBeast: Cures blindness, donates shoes, gives a waitress a car. Twitter: What a monster."<p class=align-left>@TommyFu8282 said:</p>"It's a free brand-new car. If you'd rather pay full price for a new car than get one for free with an ad on it then you're not too bright."<p class=align-left>@BassHun32718723 said:</p>"That's cheap advertisement for his business. I'd take it and have it removed or painted over even though it doesn't look all that bad."<p class=align-left>@miztaprofit said:</p>"How many ad-free cars have you given?"<h2>24-year-old Malawian foster mom Tusaiwe Munkhondiya adopts 14-year-old daughter</h2><p class=align-left><strong>Briefly News</strong> reported on Tusaiwe Munkhondiya, the 24-year-old founder of the non-profit organisation YANA based in <a href=#>Malawi</a>.</p><p class=align-left>She recently shared a heartwarming TikTok post with a <a href=#>new addition to the family</a> - a 14-year-old daughter named Cathy.
