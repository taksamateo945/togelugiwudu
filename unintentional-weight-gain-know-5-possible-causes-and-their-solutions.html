If yes, then you need to fix a few simple things in your diet and lifestyle. A healthy body weight promotes overall well-being. A healthy diet and regular exercise are two important things that affect your body weight. But there are several factors that may play a role, including levels of physical activity, stress levels, sleep patterns and more. “You might not know there are many hidden factors which can be some unexplained factors behind weight gain,” Nutritionist Lovneet Batra mentions in one of her recent Instagram posts. Let’s take a look at these factors which you should not miss.</p><h2>Some common causes of&nbsp;unintentional weight gain</h2><h3>1. Stress</h3><p>Uncontrolled stress affects the secretion of hormones that regulate your eating habits. It can lead to more cravings and make you eat more than usual. Chronic stress is also linked with a higher risk of several diseases. Therefore, try stress management techniques like meditation, yoga and exercise.</p><img decoding=async alt=5io2sdc8 id=story_image_main src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/c.ndtvimg.com/2021-09/5io2sdc8_stress_625x300_14_September_21.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=ins_instory_dv_caption>Stress can affect your eating pattern<br><span class=ins_instory_span_credit>Photo Credit: iStock</span></p><h3>2. Insomnia</h3><p>Your sleeping pattern is linked with your overall health in many ways. It can also influence your body weight. According to the nutritionist, people who are sleep deprived consume more calories to meet their energy needs, leading to weight gain.</p><p>Exercise regularly, eat light dinners and create a comfortable environment to ensure better sleep.</p><p>Also read:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Advanced Vs Beginner HIIT Exercises: Choose According To Your Fitness Levels, Here’s How</a></p><h3>3. Underactive thyroid</h3><p>Hypothyroidism, also known as underactive thyroid is a condition in which your thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone to meet the body’s requirements. Weight gain is one of the symptoms of hypothyroidism. If you are experiencing other symptoms like dry skin, fatigue, constipation, muscle weakness, hair thinning, and pain in joints, get yourself tested for hypothyroidism. Your doctor will prescribe medication.
